/**
 * UIBranchContainer represents a "branch point" in the IKAT rendering process,
 * rather than simply just a level of component containment.
 * <p>
 * UIBranchContainer has responsibility for managing naming of child components,
 * as well as separate and parallel responsibility for forms. The key to the
 * child map is the ID prefix - if the ID has no suffix, the value is the single
 * component with that ID at this level. If the ID has a suffix, indicating a
 * repetitive domain, the value is an ordered list of components provided by the
 * producer which will drive the rendering at this recursion level.
 * <p>
 * It is assumed that an ID prefix is globally unique within the tree, not just
 * within its own recursion level - i.e. IKAT resolution takes place over ALL
 * components sharing a prefix throughout the template. This is "safe" since
 * "execution" will always return to the call site once the base (XML) nesting
 * level at the target is reached again.
 * <p>
 * "Leaf" rendering classes <it>may</it> be derived from UISimpleContainer -
 * only concrete instances of UIBranchContainer will be considered as
 * representatives of pure branch points. By the time fixups have concluded, all
 * non-branching containers (e.g. UIForms) MUST have been removed from non-leaf
 * positions in the component hierarchy.
