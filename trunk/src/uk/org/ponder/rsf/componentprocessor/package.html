ComponentProcessors execute during the "fixup" stage of the render cycle, controlled
by the ViewProcessor. This "adjusts" the view tree of components to incorporate
information from the model or to resolve parameter bindings. The tree may not
be structurally modified during this phase in any way that would alter the fullID
of a component.
